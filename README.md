The beginning of a peer to peer based universal simulator


Essentially it will be a visual/audio representer of objects. Objects can have as many dimensions as you like but will only be able to interact within those dimensions with other objects that have the same dimensions.

So a level 7 particle can interact incompletely with a level 9 particle, but completely over a level 4 particle.

Once one decides on an object, by setting the configuration and proportions of the object, they then dedicate cpu power to find its resonant frequencies so it can be simplified to a point particle. Simplification will generate new levels and discard old ones.
