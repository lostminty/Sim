The beginning of a peer to peer based universal simulator


Essentially it will be a visual/audio representer of objects. Objects can have as many dimensions as you like but will only be able to interact within those dimensions with other objects that have the same dimensions.

So a level 7 particle can interact incompletely with a level 9 particle, but completely over a level 4 particle.
